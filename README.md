# quizz

A Flutter quiz application, created in order to practice creating Android and iOS apps using Google's [Flutter](https://flutter.io/) framework  and the [Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/) language. 

The tutorial followed while developing this project can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBBl1tYkUnE), slight changes have been made though.
